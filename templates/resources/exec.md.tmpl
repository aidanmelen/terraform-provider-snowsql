# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

The `snowsql_exec` resource allows for the management of the `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` lifecycles for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) objects using [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html).

## Examples

This example shows how to `create` and `delete` a Snowflake role with the `snowsql_exec` resource.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/exec/basic/main.tf.create-delete.example" }}

-> **NOTE:** It is highly recommended to test all SnowSQL statements, especially `create` and `delete` statements, in a [Snowflake worksheet](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-worksheet) prior to executing them. This can help avoid any unexpected issues during the execution of these statements.

~> **NOTE:** It is important to ensure that any `delete` statements negate any corresponding `create` statements, to avoid any orphaned Snowflake objects. Failure to do so can result in clutter and potential issues within your Snowflake environment.

### Query Snowflake With Read Statements

The `snowsql_exec` resource allows you to execute arbitrary Snowflake SQL queries from Terraform, and use the results in your infrastructure management. When using the `read` statements in the resource, the result(s) of the SQL query/queries will be available in the `read_results` attribute as a sensitive raw JSON string. 

To output the query results in a non-sensitive format to the console, you can use the `nonsensitive` function to mark the `read_results` value as non-sensitive before decoding it with the `jsondecode` function.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/exec/basic/main.tf.read.example" }}

This will output the JSON formatted results like this:

```bash
Outputs:

show_role_results = [
  {
    "assigned_to_users" = "0"
    "comment" = ""
    "created_on" = "2023-02-16T18:47:48.756-08:00"
    "granted_roles" = "0"
    "granted_to_roles" = "0"
    "is_current" = "N"
    "is_default" = "N"
    "is_inherited" = "N"
    "name" = "BASIC_CIVIL_HALIBUT"
    "owner" = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
  },
]
```

### Avoiding Replacement With Update Lifecycle

This example demonstrates the behavior of the `snowsql_exec` resource when using the optional `update` statements to modify an existing object. If the `update` statements are added or changed after the initial terraform apply, Terraform will perform an in-place change by executing the `update` statement(s). On the other hand, any changes to the `create` statements will cause a replacement of the resource.

1. The `create` statements are run on the first apply:

2. Add the `update` statements to alter the role in-place.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/exec/basic/main.tf.update.example" }}

### Multi-Statements

The `snowsql_exec` resource allows you to execute multiple SnowSQL statements separated by semicolons. This is particularly useful for managing multiple Snowflake objects within a single `snowsql_exec` resource.

-> **NOTE:** Please see the snowflakedb documentation for [Executing Multiple Statements in One Call](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Executing_Multiple_Statements_in_One_Call) for more information.

~> **NOTE:** While it may be tempting to manage multiple statements with a single `snowsql_exec` resource, it can make it much harder to managed the resource in the future, as well as potentially causing issues if the resource needs to be rolled back. It is recommended to separate multiple statements into separate resources where possible.

### Multi-line Statements

All `snowsql_exec` resource statements can be formatted across multiple lines for better readability. This is particularly useful for executing complex SnowSQL statements.
